## Planetary positions from TOP2013 analytic theories

Create JS implementations for all (truncated) [TOP2013][1] theories.
Call `script/top2013.pl 10e-6` to generate with default precision.
I used [webmerge][2] to join and minify the different functions.

I have added a few batch files for the most common scenarios.
