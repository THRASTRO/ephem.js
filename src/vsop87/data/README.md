## VSOP87 - Semi-analytic planetary theory

The semi-analytic planetary theory VSOP (French: Variations Séculaires des
Orbites Planétaires, abbreviated as VSOP) was developed and is maintained
(updating it with the results of the latest and most accurate measurements) by
the scientists at the Bureau des Longitudes in Paris, France. The first version,
VSOP82, computed only the orbital elements at any moment. An updated version,
VSOP87, besides providing improved accuracy, computed the positions of the
planets directly, as well as their orbital elements, at any moment.
