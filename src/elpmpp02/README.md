## Lunar position from ELPMPP02 analytic theory

Create JS implementations for (truncated) [ELPMPP02] [1] theory.
Call `script/elpmpp02.pl 10e-6` to generate with default precision.
I used [webmerge] [2] to join and minify the different functions.

I have added a few batch files for the most common scenarios.
