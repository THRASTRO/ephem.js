## Planetary positions from VSOP2013 analytic theories

Create JS implementations for all (truncated) [VSOP2013] [1] theories.
Call `script/vsop2013.pl 10e-6` to generate with default precision.
I used [webmerge] [2] to join and minify the different functions.

I have added a few batch files for the most common scenarios.
