   L1_2.f : It is a set of F90 FORTRAN subroutines to compute ephemerides of the
            galilean satellites from data given in file  GalileanL1.2.dat
            These ephemerides are issued from the improved accurate theory
            of the motion of the galilean satellites L1.2 described in
            'Synthetic representation of the galilean satellites orbital
            motions from L1 ephemerides', (2006, A&A 456, 783-788)

            L1_2.f  allows to compute three kinds of ephemerides for time T
            given in form of  Julian Days in the Terrestrial Time scale (TT):
            - Orbital elements of the galilean satellites Io, Europa, Ganymede
              and Callisto referred to the center of Jupiter in a fixed
              reference frame close to the jovian equatorial frame for J2000.0
              epoch,
            - Cartesian Positions-Velocities of the galilean satellites in
              this same frame,
            - Cartesian Positions-Velocities referred to Jupiter in the fixed
              celestial reference frame : mean equator and mean equinox for
              J2000.0 epoch.
            The theory has been fitted to observations between 1891 and 2003
            converted in coordinates J2000 in this last reference frame, and
            using DE406 to compute Earth-Jupiter vector.

   GalileanL1.2.dat :
            This file gives the semi-analytical representation of the
            orbital elements in a fixed jovicentric reference frame close to
            the jovian equatorial frame for J2000.0 epoch.
            The elements are :
            'a'    = semi-major axis,
            'L'    = mean longitude,
            'z'    = e exp(I w) with 'e' eccentricity, 'I' =sqrt(-1) and 'w'
                      longitude of pericenter,
            'zeta' = sin(i/2) exp(I Om) with 'i' inclination and 'Om' longitude
                      of ascending node.

            Each element is represented as a series of trigonometric terms,
            each one giving the numerical value of amplitude, frequency and
            phase, completed by the integer combination of 17 fundamental
            arguments that represents at best the frequency and the phase;
            the frequency and phase of the fundamental arguments are also given.
            The phase of arguments depending on solar perturbations are
            generally not identified and some other frequencies are also not
            identified. For those terms well identified, the precision of the
            identification in frequency and phase is also given.

            Hence, ephemerides are preferently computed from the numerical
            value of amplitude, frequency and phase of each term.

            To compute the positions and velocities of the satellites from these
            elements, the masses of Jupiter and satellites are also given, as
            well as the angles 'Psi' and 'I' connecting the fixed jovicentric
            reference frame to mean equator and mean equinox for J2000.0 epoch.
            These parameters have been fitted to observations to produce L1
            ephemerides.

            This file includes comments and is read by the subroutine
            INIT   given in  L1_2.f


            REMARK :
            This semi-analytical representation of the orbital elements has been
            obtained by applying a Frequency Analysis program to the time series
            produced by numerical integration of the dynamical system, in order
            to produce a trigonometric representation of the motions. Then, when
            searching to identify arguments of the trigonometric terms as integer
            combinations of the fundamental arguments, it appears that some terms
            in the semi-major axis of Io and Europa were aliased terms and then
            have been corrected in L1.2. These alias are very short period terms
            (with a frequency higher than  13.089969 rd/day, ie the Nyquist
            frequency of the Frequency Analysis we used). However, these have a
            very small apmlitude so that their contribution gives a correction
            to semi-major axes amounting up to  1.44 km  for Io and  3.02 km for
            Europa between  L1.1 and L1.2.

   BisL1.2.dat :
            It contains the same data as  GalileanL1.2.dat, but without comments
            This file is read by the subroutine  INITbis given in  L1_2.f


   TestL1.2.f :
            f90 FORTRAN program which uses the subroutines L1_2.f
            and shows how to monitor computations of ephemerides.

   TestL1.2.res :
            Results obtained from TestL1.2.f , giving an example of computing
            ephemerides, allowing to check computations.
