## elp2000 reference implementation directly from libnova

I translated the source code directly from [libnova] [1] to JS. It uses all terms
given by the [elp2000-82b analytic theory] [2]. The code is pretty slow, so you
probably want to use a different/truncated/optimized elp2000 implementation.
