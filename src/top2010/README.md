## Planetary positions from VSOP2010 analytic theories

Create JS implementations for all (truncated) [VSOP2010][1] theories.
Call `script/vsop2010.pl 10e-6` to generate with default precision.
I used [webmerge][2] to join and minify the different functions.

I have added a few batch files for the most common scenarios.
